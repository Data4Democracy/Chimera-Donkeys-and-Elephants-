**Slack:** [#p-chimera](https://datafordemocracy.slack.com/messages/C7RUTAK9C)

**Project Description:**
We are typing the language used in social media posts as liberal or conservative approaches based on Jonathan Haidt's work on Moral Foundations. 

**Project Lead:**

### Getting started:  -- Outline each project will have it's own
* We welcome contributions from first timers 
* This project only requires the ability to read instructions and update a spreadsheet
* Browse our help wanted issues. See if there is anything that interests you.
* Core maintainers and project leads are responsible for reviewing and merging all pull requests. In order to prevent frustrations with your first PR we recommend you reach out to our core maintainers who can help you through your first PR.
* Need to practice working with github in a group setting? Checkout [github-playground](https://github.com/Data4Democracy/github-playground)
* Updates to documentation or readme are greatly appreciated and make for a great first PR. They do not need to be discussed in advance and will be merged as soon as possible.


### Skills
* coding qualitative data
* updating spreasheets
* Theory of Moral Foundations

### Directions
* read through tweets in the data set
* code each tweet with L (liberal), C (conservative), NA (not applicable, doesn't show any persuasive language)
* make sure to code language in the tweet, and not the political leaning ex.<br>
` @funder Congratulations! Who knew the #NRA were such snowflakes? ❄️`
` RT @mcevasco: These #NRA ads are simply un-American. The road to authoritarianism is paved with garbage like this. https://t.co/QtpLcPNtip`
These tweets may look liberal, but they are using conservative methods to present their point therefore this would be labled **C**.


#### The 6 Moral Foundations
The Righteous Mind  by Jonathan Haidt outlines his Moral Foundations Theory,  6 moral foundations from which people make moral and political decisions. The following is pulled directly from The Righteous Mind and summarized for quick reference. 

The 6 Moral Foundations of Politics

Political parties and interest groups strive to make their concerns trigger moral values. Using emotion rather than logical arguments to trigger moral values have been found to be a huge driver of how people will eventually vote. The values are expressed differently among liberal politics and conservative politics. 
Below each foundation is briefly summarized to explain how this value is triggered emotionally. These foundations have been found to be innate to all humans, although expressed differently in different cultures. The fact that they are innate speaks to how profound the emotional response is when they are triggered.

##### The Care/Harm Foundation
This makes us sensitive to signs of  suffering and need. It also makes us despise cruelty and want to care for those who are suffering. 
###### Liberal Vs Conservative:
Liberals tend to apply this foundation to people and animals. (ex: immigrants, vulnerable populations, endangered animals)
Conservatives tend to apply to those who have suffered for the group, more local than global, and blended with loyalty. (ex: wounded warriors)<br>
**Codes**)<br>
Liberals:  Expresses desire to care and protect vulnerable groups (human or non-human)
Conservatives: Expresses care about people who have sacrificed or done service for the greater community.

##### The Fairness/Cheating Foundation
It makes us sensitive to implications that another person is likely to be good or bad partner for collaboration. It makes us want to shun and punish cheaters.  
###### Liberal Vs Conservative:
Liberals tend to equate concerns with equality and social justice with fairness. On the left, fairness implies equality. (ex. The wealthy not paying their fair share of the taxes)
Conservatives tend to apply this foundation to the socialization of economic burdens. On the right, fairness implies proportionality. (ex. Welfare and unemployment benefits, free health care))<br>
**Codes**)<br>
Liberal: Expresses concern with equality between people.
Conservative: Communicates concern over proportional sharing of economic burdens.

##### The Loyalty/Betrayal Foundation
It makes us sensitive to whether a person is, or is not a team player. It makes us trust and reward team players. It makes us hurt, ostracize, or even kill those who betray us or our group. 
###### Liberal Vs Conservative:
Liberals tend towards universalism, and away from nationalism. (ex. “Global citizen of the world”)
Conservatives tend to apply this foundation to loyalty, almost in the same way that someone is loyal to their home team. As a result, those who are the opposite are the enemy. (ex. “If you are not for me, you are against me”))<br>
**Codes**)<br>
Liberal: Expresses sensitivity to being part of the global community.
Conservative: Expresses loyalty to group and treats others not in the group as the enemy.

##### The Authority/Subversion Foundation
It makes us sensitive to signs of rank or status and to sign of other people’s good or bad behavior, given their position.  
###### Liberal Vs Conservative:
Liberals tend to believe that hierarchies = power = exploitation = evil. They are more suspicious of power and believe it leads to inequality. (ex. Occupy wall street movement)
Conservatives tend to believe that is important to respect the hierarchy and respect authoritative figures. This process creates order, which creates a predictable and safe society (ex. Evangelical christian beliefs))<br>
**Codes**)<br>
Liberal: Conversation is about hierarchical power relationships creating inequality. 
Conservative: Conversation is about a hierarchical power relationships creating respect and safety.

##### The Sanctity/Degradation Foundation
It makes us sensitive to a diverse array of symbolic objects or threats. It makes it possible for people to invest objects with extreme values--both positive and negative--which are important for binding a group together. 
###### Liberal Vs Conservative:
Liberals tend to be more open to new ideas, people and ways of life. They are less tied to tradition and not as threatened by change. (ex. multiculturalism)
Conservatives prefer to stick to what is tried and true. They care a lot more about guarding borders, boundaries, and traditions. (ex. Nationalism, patriotism))<br>
**Codes**)<br>
Liberal: Express openness to new ideas, peoples,  and embrace change.
Conservative: Express desire to stick to traditions, and hope to guard boundaries and borders.

##### The Liberty/Oppression Foundation
This makes us sensitive to signs of attempted domination. This foundation is triggered when by anything or anyone that is perceived as imposing illegitimate restrains on one’s liberty. 
###### Liberal Vs Conservative:
Liberals tend to apply this foundation to underdogs, victims and powerless groups. It leads liberals (but not others), to sacralize equality, which is then pursued by fighting for civil rights and human rights (ex. guaranteed minimum income).
Conservatives tend to apply this foundation to economic and trade policies. (ex. “Don’t tred on my business with your oppressive regulations”, “Don’t tread on my nation with your United Nations and International treaties, “don’t tread on me with your high taxes”))<br>
**Codes**)<br>
Liberal: Conversation about restraints of liberty or opression for underdog groups. (Flag:  This is very similar to the liberal Cheating/Fairness foundation)
Conservative: Expresses ideas about being nationally oppressed due to economic or trade policies


In general, Republicans/Conservatives/Libertarians understand these moral foundations and use them all in their advertising, rhetoric and arguments. Democrats/Liberals tend to rely on the the care/harm and fairness/cheating. They do not use all the foundations, and do not structure their arguments or rhetoric to appeal to all.
